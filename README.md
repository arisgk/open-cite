# OpenCite

OpenCite add-in for Microsoft Word.

## Quick Start

### Pre-requisites

You will need a version of Microsoft Word to side-load the plugin for development (either desktop app or web app).

### Development

Clone the project, navigate to its root directory and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

If you are on Windows and have Microsoft Word desktop app, it will automatically open a document with the add-in sideloaded.

If you are using the web application of Microsoft Word, you will need to upload the add-in manifest file to it from the _Insert_ menu.
